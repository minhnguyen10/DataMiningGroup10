## Income Prediction using adult census
Predicting income is an important task for institutions such as the government, companies, and social organizations. Machine learning, in recent years, has become a vital prediction approach due to its accurate prediction of peopleâ€™s income based on census information. There has been a considerably large number of projects adopting traditional machine learning approaches to predict income decently, but they could not reach above certain accuracy. Therefore, to explore multiple features for predicting models and try to achieve better accuracy, we apply seven machine learning models with fine-tune, including decision tree, random forest, KNN, naive bayes, XGBoost, Neural Network and LightGBM . Plus, we also perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis of adult census information, providing extra details that might benefit in the future. 

## Running Intrustion
The raw data is in *adult.csv*, which can be found here <br />
*DataProcessing.ipynb* provides the data pre-processing and generates *cleaned_adult.csv* <br />
*Models.ipynb* includes the implementations of different machine leanring models and attempt to use oversampling/undersampling <br />
*CNN.ipynb* includes code for implentations of neural network approach <br />
